# Project agent memory

This file is the project's committed home for project-intrinsic agent knowledge: build, test, release, architecture, and sharp-edge notes that should travel with the code.

## What scoursh is

`scoursh` ("scan exhaustively") is a shell-based, air-gapped security scanner.
One tool audits three surfaces: source code (SAST plus SCA plus IaC), a running endpoint (DAST), and AWS configuration (live read-only plus IaC).

It is **target-agnostic**.
No application, company, product, environment, or endpoint name is ever baked into a script, a rule, or a document.
Every site-specific value comes from the operator's config at runtime.
Rules describe *classes* of issue, never a specific system.
This is `docs/DESIGN.md` §1 and it is a hard rule for every change.

## The no-egress rule, and why it drives everything

Exactly two kinds of outbound traffic are permitted:

1. `curl` to a host the operator authorised in `config/scope.conf`.
2. Read-only AWS API calls to the operator's own account.

Everything else is forbidden: no telemetry, no SaaS backend, no fetching rules or advisories at scan time.
The tool must run on an air-gapped host.

This single constraint explains most of the architecture, so do not "improve" a design decision without checking it against this first:

- Rules, payloads, wordlists, and advisory data are **vendored in the repo** and read from disk.
- `tools/vendor-engines.sh` is the only script that touches the internet, is never called during a scan, and is quarantined and documented as such.
- Every network call goes through the single wrapper `lib/http.sh`, which refuses any host absent from the resolved allowlist.
- Every AWS call goes through `lib/awscli.sh`, which refuses any operation that is not read-only (`docs/FOUNDATION.md` tension 23).
- The HTML report is self-contained with no external assets and a strict inline CSP, because a report that fetches a font is egress.
- Version-range arithmetic for SCA is done on the networked box and shipped pre-expanded, so the scanner only does table lookups (`docs/FOUNDATION.md` tension 25).

## Documents, and which one wins

| Document | Role |
|---|---|
| `docs/DESIGN.md` | The handoff spec. **Preserved verbatim**; its wording is load-bearing. Do not rewrite, re-order, summarise, or "improve" it. |
| `docs/FOUNDATION.md` | The design-tension register. 26 tensions, each with a committed RESOLUTION. **Where it contradicts the letter of `docs/DESIGN.md`, it wins**, and it says so explicitly at each point. |
| `rules/RULE-FORMAT.md` | The **FROZEN** on-disk record format. Normative and self-contained. |

Read all three before changing anything structural.
`docs/FOUNDATION.md` exists so that decisions are not re-litigated; if you disagree with a resolution, change the register deliberately and cost the change, do not quietly diverge in code.

## The frozen record format

`rules/RULE-FORMAT.md` defines blank-line-separated `key: value` block records.
It replaces the pipe-delimited rule format sketched in `docs/DESIGN.md` §6.2, because any regex containing `|` silently corrupts a pipe-delimited field split, and the §6.3 rule catalog is full of such regexes.
The rule **catalog** in §6.3 is unchanged; only the on-disk encoding is.

It is used by **every human-authored file**: all `*.rules` packs, `rules/derived.rules`, `rules/redaction.rules`, `modules/<m>/checks.rules`, and every `config/*.conf` including `config/scope.conf`.
Machine-generated files use JSON or the frozen TSV instead (`findings.jsonl`, `run.json`, `state/*.json`, `config/baseline.json`, `data/advisories.db`).

Key properties, so you do not have to re-read the spec to avoid breaking it:

- Values carry **no escaping at all**; the bytes after the first `": "` to end of line are the value.
- Comments are whole-line only (first byte `#`), so `#` is free inside values.
- A blank line separates records; a whitespace-only line is an **error**, not a separator.
- CRLF and BOM are errors, because a stray `\r` would silently end up inside every regex.
- Prose fields get multiple lines via two-space continuation lines; `pattern` is always single-line.
- Regexes declare a `dialect`, defaulting to a frozen portable ERE subset that behaves identically under `rg` and `grep -E`.

**The format is FROZEN.**
Every later module depends on it, and check ids feed the finding fingerprint, so a change invalidates `state/` and `config/baseline.json` and breaks the "fail only on new findings" CI mode.
The full cost is enumerated in `rules/RULE-FORMAT.md` §14, and a change requires a `format_version` bump and a `state/` migration.

## Sharp edges that are easy to get wrong

These are resolved decisions, not open questions.
Each has a full entry in `docs/FOUNDATION.md`.

- **The composite fingerprint's first component is the literal `composite`, not the finding's `module` field** (tension 6). The module field is `derived`; the two are different strings for different jobs. Passing the module through hashed `derived` and produced an identity no conformant implementation agrees with - invisible, because a composite fingerprint is only ever compared with itself. Assert it against a digest computed from raw bytes, never through `fingerprint_compute`.
- **Never put a line number in a fingerprint** (tension 5). It would make every finding `new` after any unrelated edit, destroying the diff, the baseline, and the CI gate. Repeated byte-identical matches in one file are told apart by an `occurrence` ordinal, not a line.
- **`fixed` is inferred only inside a covered (check, scope-cell) pair** (tension 12). Check-id-alone coverage lets a `--regions` or `--target` run report every unvisited region's or target's findings as remediated.
- **Never call `grep` or `rg` bare** (tension 4). `set -Eeuo pipefail` is mandatory and grep exits 1 on no-match, which is the normal case. Use `scan_match`, which distinguishes no-match from engine failure.
- **The `EXIT` cleanup trap is guarded on scratch-dir OWNERSHIP, never on subshell-ness** (tension 4 rule 5, finding F13, closed). The guard is `scratch_is_owned_here`: the creating process records its pid in a non-exported variable AND in an on-disk marker, and cleanup no-ops unless both say this process. Do not reach for `[[ $BASHPID == $$ ]]`: bash resets trapped `EXIT` actions in subshells, so that guard defends a case bash never produces, and it PASSES in an `xargs -P` worker - which is a fresh process - so the first worker to finish erases the shared scratch dir. Both halves are measured in `tests/suites/core.sh`.
- **The scratch dir holds only genuinely transient data** (finding F12): `scan_match` line files, the mutexes, and the rate, budget and breaker state. Finding shards and the unit journal live under `reports/<run>/` unconditionally, because the EXIT trap erases the scratch dir on the SIGTERM that resume itself is tested with. `--keep-shards` means "do not delete after a successful merge".
- **`msleep` reads a FIFO the process holds open read-write, and is chosen by MEASUREMENT** (tension 24, finding F14). `read -t </dev/null` returns at EOF instantly and does not sleep, and `read` returns non-zero for EOF and timeout alike, so an exit-status probe cannot tell them apart.
- **The mutex reclaim is single-winner and identity-bound** (tension 16, finding F15). A bare `rm -rf` of a stale lock can delete a *live* one and put two processes in the critical section. `lock_is_stale` needs BOTH age and non-liveness; requiring both is what bounds pid reuse.
- **Nothing exits outside 0-5** (tension 14, finding F16). `die` validates its code. `shred` is GNU-only and absent on macOS; it sits behind `erase_dir`, and overwrite-based erasure is best effort - `scratch-dir` on a tmpfs is the real control.
- **Shared state across `xargs -P` workers goes in files under an atomic-`mkdir` mutex** (tension 16). The rate limiter, request budget, circuit breaker, and AWS cache are all per-process otherwise, so `--jobs 8` means 8x the request rate and a breaker that never trips.
- **Workers write to their own shard file, never a shared `findings.jsonl`** (tension 17). Appends above `PIPE_BUF` interleave.
- **Never `source` a config file** (tension 26). It is a code-execution vector that would run before the scope gate is consulted.
- **A partial run must never report `fixed`** (tension 12). `state/` tracks coverage as **(check, scope-cell)** pairs; a prior finding whose own cell was not visited is `unknown`. `path-root` cells are comparable only between runs with the same `scan_root_id` (other cell kinds carry no path and are not gated by it). Two families refine this and can only narrow it: `SAST-HIST-*` adds a per-finding history-boundary test (tension 13), and a composite is `fixed` only when **(a)** its own record was selected this run, **(b)** every check in `requires`/`any-of` is covered - contributors that fired under the test that would let *their own* finding be `fixed`, listed checks that did not fire by being covered **this run** at all (a check with no entry in this run's `covered_checks` is never covered, whatever the prior run recorded) **and** having every cell the prior run covered them over revisited - and **(c)** the predicate no longer holds (tension 6). Reading contributor cells alone is not enough: it misses an unselected composite and a history contributor whose boundary has receded.
- **The scan root is a defined term** (tension 12): the git toplevel of the resolved `--path`, else the resolved `--path`. Every "repository-relative path" means scan-root-relative. scoursh's own install root is a different thing (tension 26).
- **An unusable diff is fail-closed at the gate** (tension 11 step 7). No prior state, an `fp_schema` mismatch, or a `scan_root_id` mismatch **on a run whose findings live in `path-root` cells** all set `diff_usable = false` (a `cloud`/`dast`/`posture`-only run is unaffected by `scan_root_id`, since those cells carry no path), and `--fail-on-new` then gates on **all** findings. `diff_usable` governs the **gate only** and never overrides a `status`: a first run's findings are `new` per tension 12's table, not `unknown`.
- **A secret is never a command-line argument and never touches disk raw** (tension 9). `sha256_of` reads stdin only.
- **Evidence is untrusted target output** (tension 10). It goes through `finding_set_evidence` and is escaped per emitter; the HTML report contains no `<script>` at all.

## Build order and where we are

`docs/DESIGN.md` §13 gives the build order, in ten steps, starting with `lib/core.sh` / `lib/findings.sh` / `lib/report.sh` and ending with SARIF plus the compliance report plus docs.

This paragraph and `docs/FOUNDATION.md`'s "Where the build currently stands" are
part of the deliverable for every step ticket, not follow-up work: filing a
separate documentation ticket to update them later is not an acceptable
substitute, however small the wording change looks. A step landed without this
paragraph and its FOUNDATION.md mirror updated in the same commit range is not
done, full stop - close the gap in the step ticket itself.

**Current position: §13 step 1 is done. The next task is step 2.**

Step 1 delivered `lib/records.sh`, `lib/core.sh`, `lib/findings.sh` and `lib/report.sh`, plus
`rules/redaction.rules`, `data/severity-rubric.conf`, the `config/*.example` files, a fixture
end-to-end path under `tests/e2e/`, and the test suite.
The six findings that blocked it (F13, F14, F12, F15, F16, and F18 by consequence) are **closed**, each
in the tension that owns it; see `docs/FOUNDATION.md` "Known follow-ups".

**What step 1 deliberately did not build**, so the boundary is not rediscovered: `scan.sh`, anything
under `modules/`, `lib/http.sh`, `lib/engines.sh`, `lib/awscli.sh`, SARIF, the compliance report, any
shipped rule pack, and `state/`.
Diff classification (tension 12) and baseline suppression (tension 11 steps 5 and 6) belong to step 7;
step 1 ships the primitives they call - the merge, the fingerprint, `findings_mark_suppressed`, and
`classify_derived`, which is pure and already tested against tension 6's whole case table.

**Two run.json fields are deliberately empty at step 1**, rather than absent, so a
consumer never has to handle a missing key and the gap is visible in the output:

- `regions` is `[]`. Region iteration is `modules/cloud/aws/regions.sh` at step 6;
  nothing before it visits a region, and inferring regions from a finding's cell
  would report where findings happened to land rather than where the run looked.
- `run_identity` is absent. `docs/FOUNDATION.md` tension 18 records it in
  run.json, but its inputs include the normalised CLI flags, which arrive with
  `scan.sh` at step 2.

`checks_run` is the set of checks the run LOADED AND EXECUTED. It is not
tension 12's `covered_checks`, which is per-(check, cell) coverage persisted in
`state/` and owned by step 7: a check can be in `checks_run` and still be
uncovered for a cell the run never visited.

`rules/derived.rules` is **not** seeded, and that is deliberate: findings F5 and F20 record that
`COMPOSITE-TOKEN-HIJACK`'s contributors do not exist until steps 5 and 6, so seeding it now is a
guaranteed `E051` lint failure.  The derived *mechanism* is delivered and is tested against a fixture
composite under `tests/fixtures/rules/derived.rules`.

**Read `docs/FOUNDATION.md` "Known follow-ups" before starting step 2.**
Six findings remain open (F4, F3, F5, F20, F8, F17, plus F16's `look` half); all are cheap corrections
that cost nothing to defer, and each names the step it must land before.

Two amendments to §13 come from `docs/FOUNDATION.md` and applied from the start:

- `lib/records.sh` (the record parser) is built **before** step 1's stated contents, since tensions 1, 6, 9, 15, and 26 all depend on it.
- `lib/awscli.sh` is added to the layout and lands at the start of step 6, before any `aws/live/*.sh` script exists, so no script is ever written against a bare `aws`.

## Tests

```
tests/run-tests.sh                 # everything: five suites plus four linters
tests/run-tests.sh --list          # what is available
tests/run-tests.sh records         # one suite: records | core | findings | report | e2e
tests/run-tests.sh lint-rules      # or one linter by name
tests/lint-rules.sh                # record-format linter, error codes in rules/RULE-FORMAT.md §13
tests/lint-shell.sh                # the tension 4, 9, 24 and 26 shell lints
tests/lint-aws-readonly.sh         # read-only AWS lint, docs/FOUNDATION.md tension 23
tests/e2e/fixture-scan.sh <dir>    # the end-to-end path on its own, for eyeballing a report
```

`package.json` at the repository root exists **only** so the conventional `pnpm test` / `npm test`
entry point runs the real suite above.
`pnpm test` is a thin alias for `bash tests/run-tests.sh`: no dependencies, no lockfile, no
`node_modules`, no build step.
scoursh has no Node runtime dependency and is not becoming a Node project; the shell entry point,
`tests/run-tests.sh`, remains the real one and the one to run directly when Node/npm/pnpm are not on
the box.
Anyone tempted to add a dependency, a devDependency, or tooling config to `package.json` has
misunderstood why it exists - don't.

Each suite runs in its own process, because `lib/core.sh` installs traps, sets shell options and owns a
scratch directory: a suite sharing a shell with another would not be testing what the tool does.
`shellcheck` runs over everything if it is installed and is skipped with a notice if it is not, since an
air-gapped host may not have it.

**Every test that pins a decision names the reading it fails under.**
That is not a style preference: review round 5 found that four rounds had all written the test after the
rule, so every suite agreed with its author's reading and certified the defect green.
A test that passes under both the correct and the rejected reading pins nothing and is worse than no
test, because it buys false confidence.

What the suite covers now, per `docs/DESIGN.md` §12 and the resolutions above:

- Every worked example in `rules/RULE-FORMAT.md` §12 and every negative example in §12.6, with the right error code at the right line and column.
- Fingerprint stability under reindentation and line shifts; five byte-identical matches in one file yielding five fingerprints; no duplicate fingerprint in the merged output.
- Tension 6's derived-finding case table, including cases 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9, each of which the round-2 rule returned `fixed` for.
- Redaction across all four output formats, with two distinct secrets yielding two distinct digests.
- Hostile evidence: a script tag, an ANSI sequence, a raw newline, invalid UTF-8 and a backtick run, asserted escaped in every emitter, with the CSP present and no `<script>` in the HTML.
- Byte-reproducible `findings.jsonl` across two runs.
- The five closed findings, each with a test that fails under the original implementation.

Still to come with their steps: SARIF schema validation (step 10), the read-only lint over a non-empty
`aws/live/` (step 6), a no-egress run under `--paranoid` (step 8), and byte-identical findings between
GNU and BSD userlands, which needs CI on both (`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the matrix).

## Things measured on this codebase, not assumed

Recorded because the review rounds found several confidently-stated shell facts that were simply wrong.

- `local a=$1 b=${#a}` gives `b=0`. Assignments in one `local` do not see each other; use two lines.
- Bash resets trapped `EXIT` actions in subshells. `xargs -P` workers are fresh processes and DO run them.
- A side-effecting function called as `$(f)` runs in a subshell and its writes are discarded. `occurrence_next` and `worker_id_set` therefore SET a variable rather than printing one; getting this wrong silently collapses every repeated match onto one fingerprint.
- BSD awk evaluates the source constant `0x80` as `0`, so hex literals are a GNU extension. The UTF-8 validator is pure bash for that reason.
- Bash's `=~` uses the system regcomp, which on macOS/BSD supports none of `\b`, `\w`, `\s`, `\d`. `grep -E` and `rg` support all four on both userlands. `redact()` therefore routes through the engine wrapper rather than matching in-process.
- `-n -b -o` produces byte-identical output under ripgrep 15.1.0 and BSD grep 2.6.0-FreeBSD, which is what `rules/RULE-FORMAT.md` §10.3's per-match ordinal needs.
- `printf '--- ...'` is parsed as options by bash's builtin printf; use `printf -- '--- ...'`.
- `find` over a directory that does not exist fails, and under `pipefail` takes the whole pipeline with it.
- ShellCheck versions disagree: Ubuntu's reports `SC2119`/`SC2120` where 0.11.0 does not. CI runs whatever the image ships, so a finding is silenced with an explicit `# shellcheck disable=` and a reason rather than left to the version.
- A comment line beginning `# shellcheck ` is parsed as a DIRECTIVE, so prose about shellcheck must not start a line with that word.
